# ANN_SVHN_ID_Project
An AI Vision Computing Project: House Number Recognition, with an Artificial Neural Network

The main objective of the project was to develop a system that could accurately recognize and extract house numbers from images. To achieve this, we compared the latest techniques in computer vision and deep learning to create a robust and scalable solution. The system was trained on a large dataset of images, containing a diverse range of house numbers in different conditions and environments.

This model is built using Keras architecture. Please see my CNN Vision project on the SVHN dataset. Additionally, please see my fastai 2 Vision project, on facial emotion recogniton.
